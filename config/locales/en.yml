    Not for you huh? We're enabling retweets on your timeline now. You probably
    know the drill by now but just to recap: it takes a minute, and it's not
    retroactive. Try not to think about all the fascinating retweets you've
    missed.

    You got it, we're disabling retweets on your timeline now. It takes a
    minute, so just calm down. It's also not retroactive, so you'll only notice
    the changes for tweets going forward. It can take a few minutes depending on
    how many people you follow, and how backed up we are.

    Drat! Something didn't work. I'm really sorry about that. I'll try to fix
    any bugs I see come in, in a timely manner. But this is a free service, so
    you know... you get what you pay for ðŸ˜¬
